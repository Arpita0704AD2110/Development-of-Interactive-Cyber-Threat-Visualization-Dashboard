        "\n",
        "*   **Introduction to Data Types**: The process successfully defined Python data types as classifications that specify the nature of data and permissible operations, emphasizing that \"everything in Python is an object,\" each with an associated data type.\n",
        "*   **Numeric Data Types (`int`, `float`, `complex`)**:\n",
        "    *   Integers (`int`), floating-point numbers (`float`), and complex numbers (`complex`) were clearly introduced with their characteristics and use cases.\n",
        "    *   Demonstrations included variable creation and basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulo, exponentiation).\n",
        "    *   It was highlighted that standard division (`/`) of integers results in a `float`, while floor division (`//`) maintains an `int`.\n",
        "*   **Boolean Data Type (`bool`)**:\n",
        "    *   The `bool` type, representing `True` or `False`, was explained as fundamental for decision-making.\n",
        "    *   Demonstrations covered logical operations (`and`, `or`, `not`), conditional statements (`if`/`else`), and the crucial concept of \"truthiness\" and \"falsiness\" for various Python objects (e.g., empty strings, lists, or `0` are `False`; non-empty strings, non-zero numbers are `True`).\n",
        "*   **Sequence Data Types (`str`, `list`, `tuple`)**:\n",
        "    *   All sequence types were characterized as ordered, indexed, and iterable.\n",
        "    *   **Strings (`str`)** were shown to be immutable, supporting concatenation, repetition, indexing, slicing, and methods like `.upper()`, `.lower()`, `.replace()`, `.split()`, and `.find()`.\n",
        "    *   **Lists (`list`)** were demonstrated as mutable, supporting dynamic modification via methods like `.append()`, `.insert()`, `.remove()`, `.pop()`, and direct element assignment by index.\n",
        "    *   **Tuples (`tuple`)** were confirmed as immutable, with attempts to modify elements correctly raising a `TypeError`, but still supporting concatenation, repetition, indexing, and slicing.\n",
        "*   **Mapping Data Type (`dict`)**:\n",
        "    *   Dictionaries were explained as unordered (ordered in Python 3.7+), mutable collections of unique key-value pairs.\n",
        "    *   It was explicitly shown that keys must be immutable (e.g., `str`, `int`, `tuple`), with attempts to use mutable types like `list` as keys resulting in a `TypeError`.\n",
        "    *   Demonstrations included creation, access (using `[]` or `.get()`), addition, modification, removal (`del`, `.pop()`), and methods like `.keys()`, `.values()`, and `.items()`.\n",
        "*   **Set Data Type (`set`)**:\n",
        "    *   Sets were defined as unordered collections of unique and immutable elements.\n",

        "*   **Dataset Overview**: A sample DataFrame was created with 7 entries and 4 columns: 'Name' (object/string), 'Age' (int64, then converted to float64), 'Score' (float64), and 'City' (object/string).\n",
        "*   **Data Quality**:\n",
        "    *   Initially, the dataset had no missing values.\n",
        "    *   During cleaning, a missing value was introduced in the 'Score' column, which was then imputed using the mean score of approximately 84.47.\n",
        "    *   A duplicate row was introduced and subsequently removed, restoring the DataFrame to its original 7 unique entries.\n",
        "*   **Numerical Data Statistics**:\n",
        "    *   **Age**: Ranges from 22 to 40 years, with a mean of approximately 29.29 and a median of 28.00.\n",
        "    *   **Score**: Ranges from 70.20 to 95.70, with a mean of approximately 84.47 and a median of 85.50.\n",
        "*   **City-Specific Patterns**:\n",
        "    *   The dataset contains 7 unique cities, with one entry per city.\n",
        "    *   Phoenix shows the highest average score (95.70) with an average age of 28.0.\n",
        "    *   Philadelphia exhibits the lowest average score (70.20) but the highest average age (40.0).\n",
        "    *   Chicago has the lowest average age (22.0) with an average score of 78.30.\n",
        "*   **Visualizations**: Histograms were generated to visualize the distributions of 'Age' and 'Score', and a bar chart displayed the average 'Score' by 'City', reinforcing the city-specific performance differences.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "*   There appears to be a notable variation in average scores across different cities, with Phoenix performing highest and Philadelphia lowest. This suggests potential geographical or contextual factors influencing performance that warrant further investigation.\n",
        "*   Further analysis could involve exploring the correlation between age and score, or incorporating additional features (if available) such as educational background or experience, to build a predictive model for score based on individual attributes and city.\n"
